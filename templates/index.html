Here's How You Can Unleash Your Inner Singer:

Voice Training: Dive into the world of vocal transformation by selecting "Train Model" from the generate menu. Upload 5 minutes of your audio in mp3 format. This could be anything from a simple narration to a song snippet, in any language. Your voice is the key that unlocks endless possibilities.

Whether it includes music or pure vocals, we've got you covered. Monitor the conversion under "Voice Conversion Jobs," and upon completion, download your transformed song.

Generate Your Music Video: For the grand finale, select "Generate Video" from the generate menu. Choose your converted song and select an avatar to star in your personalized music video. Once the video job is done, a downloadable link will bring your virtual performance to life.
